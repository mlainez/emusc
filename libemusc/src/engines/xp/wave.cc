       Read forward - which is what this returned until TASK-183 - every
       control-0x10 loop jumps in phase once per traversal, and that is the
       pop the owner reported on the French Horn for weeks. It is not one
       instrument: over the whole wave ROM, the correlation ACROSS the join
       of a loop played forward is +0.968 at the median for the 1518
       descriptors that carry 0x00 and +0.197 for the 215 that carry 0x10.
       The 0x00 loops tile; the 0x10 loops do not, and 0x10 is on exactly
       the material a designer cannot cut to a whole number of periods -
       Choir, Strings, Church Organ, French Horn, Tremolo Strings,
       Overdrive, Timpani.

       But a ping-pong turn in a DIFFERENTIAL format is not a time reversal.
       The decoder is an accumulator over deltas; running the address back
       down the stream while still adding what it reads gives

           y[m] = x[c] + d[c] + ... + d[c-m+1] = 2*x[c] - x[c-m]

       - the loop backwards AND reflected about the value it turned at,
       which is continuous in value and in SLOPE. A plain time reversal
       leaves a corner instead, and measures worse than the forward read,
       which is how the forward reading came to look right.

       The ROM is cut for the reflected turn: over all 1733 looping
       descriptors the deltas from address_b to address_c sum to EXACTLY
       zero, so x[c] == x[b-1] without a single exception. That is what
       lands the reflected pass on x[b-1] as its address reaches b-1, so
       the cycle closes with no step and no drift.

       Measured, French Horn C4, worst period-to-period correlation through
       the sustain: forward 0.780, plain time reversal -0.424, reflected
       0.987, against the hardware recording's 0.992. Over the eighteen
       control-0x10 instruments that have an SC-88 recording, p50 goes from
       +0.370 to +0.941 where the hardware's own is +0.926, and where the
       hardware dips we now dip with it. The 0x00 renders are unchanged
       byte for byte, and the corrected 63-instrument audit does not move:
       median MAD 2.1 dB, 46 within 3 dB, 7 past 6. */

/* THE DESCRIPTOR CARRIES TWO PITCH CORRECTIONS AND THE TUNING IS THEIR SUM.

   A looping descriptor's `+4` and `+14` are both signed words in the pitch
   domain where one octave is 16384 units.  `+4` alone is what the voice path
   used, and it leaves 686 of the ROM's 1713 looping descriptors out of tune.

   The ROM says so by itself, because a looping wave's period is not a matter
   of opinion: the loop from `address_b` to `address_c` is cut to a whole
   number of cycles of the note the descriptor names as its root key.  Predict
   the loop's own rate as `32000 / (c - b + 1) * 2**(correction / 16384)`,
   take the nearest whole number of root-key cycles it spans, and read off the
   error in cents.  Over every looping descriptor in 0x36100..0x3f714:

       group                       correction   median  p90   within 2 cents
       +14 == 0   (n = 1024)       base          0.22   7.10      82.7 %
       +14 != 0   (n =  685)       base          1.77  10.10      53.6 %
       +14 != 0   (n =  685)       base + alt    0.13   0.36      97.1 %
       |+14| >= 20 (n =  392)      base          3.80  12.69      22.2 %
       |+14| >= 20 (n =  392)      base + alt    0.21   0.37      98.2 %
       |+14| >= 20 (n =  392)      base - alt    7.67  25.11       2.3 %

   The first row is the null and it validates the method: where `+14` is
   already zero the two readings are the same expression and the loops land
   on their root key to a fifth of a cent.  The `base - alt` row is the same
   magnitude with the wrong sign and it is twice as bad as doing nothing, so
   the measurement can fail and does.  Paired on the 379 descriptors whose
   whole-cycle count is the same under both readings, `base + alt` is the
   closer of the two on 377.

   THE FIRMWARE ADDS IT, UNDER A CONDITION THAT IS NOT RECOVERED.  `0x612c`
   `ed 04 83` loads the descriptor's `+4` into the pitch sum; `0x612f`
   `f1 25 da f0` tests bit 0 of the per-voice byte at DP:`0x25da` + slot and
   `0x6133` skips over `0x6135` `ed 0e 23`, which adds `+14`, when it is
   clear.  That flag is cleared for every slot at power-on (`0x1154f`) and
   again at `0x5dfc`, three instructions before the same routine calls the
   pitch composition at `0x6077`; it is SET at `0x5334` `f1 25 da c0`.  The
   corrected listing desynchronises across both `0x5334` and `0x5dfc` - it
   reads them as `bcs.b` and `bclr.w` inside other instructions - so the
   setter was believed not to exist; the raw bytes are unambiguous.  What
   reaches `0x5334` is not traced, so WHEN the chip applies the alternate
   correction is open, and adding it always is a choice rather than a
   recovered condition.

   It is the choice the ROM's own tuning supports, and the hardware agrees on
   the tone that raised the question.  `Charang` (program 84) sounds a
   `DIST_GT` zone whose `+14` is zero beside a `SITAR` zone at 0x3b4ac whose
   `+14` is +132.  At C5 the first plays at 523.99 Hz; the second plays at
   519.65 Hz on `+4` alone and at 522.56 Hz with both, so the pair beats at
   8.4 Hz or at 2.8 Hz at the octave.  The hardware recording of that note
   carries no 8.4 Hz modulation in its 1.0-1.1 kHz band at all, and the
   render on `+4` alone carries it as the strongest line after the note's own
   envelope. */

/* The thirty organ descriptors the SC-88 reads at twice the rate.

   The behaviour is settled and measured against hardware, and the mechanism
   is NOT recovered.  The Drawbar Organ C3 recording carries the nine Hammond
   drawbar footages with 40 dB holes at harmonics 5, 7, 9 and 11; the ROM loop
   the key-48 zone selects reproduces that hole pattern only when the loop is
   read at 2x: on Percussive Organ C3 the fifth harmonic is -54.2 dB against
   the recording's -55.2 read at 2x, and 16.2 dB out read at 1x.  Read at 1x, which is what the
   arithmetic in `sc88_renderer_static_pitch_word` gives, the registration
   moves half an octave down, the holes fill, and both organs sound an octave
   below the note.

   This predicate is a model of that BEHAVIOUR, not of the machine.  Neither
   the H8/520 nor the XP can compute it at note-on: it is a property of the
   decoded waveform, and the CPU never decodes a sample.  Three lanes searched
   for the mechanism and closed every source this project can read - all 160
   descriptor bits, the whole 512 KB control ROM and all eight 1 MiB wave banks
   at every base and strides 1/2/4, the SC-88 Pro's own firmware and descriptor
   table, the seven demo songs, and Sound Canvas VA's records and code.  The
   sibling device says what the missing field would look like and that the
   SC-88 does not have it: on the JV-880 the Marimba samples carry the same
   mismatch the other way up - their loops hold half a root-key period per
   waveform cycle - and its tone record reconciles it with a stored coarse
   tune of -12 semitones at +37.  The SC-88 has that field, component +0x16,
   with a -36..+24 semitone range that 65 components use; it reads zero on
   every organ component, and it is per-component while the defect is
   per-zone - E.Organ 1's single component reaches two clean zones and nine
   affected ones.

   The rule, on the loop's own decoded content, with `L` the loop length and
   `root` the descriptor's root key:

     P = 32000 / (440 * 2^((root - 69) / 12))    root-key period, in samples
     u = L / P                                   root-key cycles in the loop
     h = u / 2

   `u` must be within 0.02 of an even integer at least two, so that bin `h`
   exists.  Then, with `A_k` the loop's DFT magnitude at bin k:

     the loudest bin below h is at most -15 dB relative to A_h, and
     A_h is at least -7 dB relative to A_u.

   Together: the loop is a harmonic tone whose own fundamental sits an octave
   below its root pitch.  Both thresholds are the middle of a measured gap
   over the 113 forward-looping descriptors whose loop spans an even whole
   number of root-key cycles.  The first clause separates -26.6 dB (the worst
   of the thirty) from +4.5 dB (the best of the rest), 31.1 dB wide; the
   second separates -2.45 dB from -11.35 dB, 8.90 dB wide.  The selection is
   exactly those thirty for every first threshold in -25..-6 dB crossed with
   every second in -11.3..-2.5 dB.

   `pcm` is the decoded sample, `base_address` the wave address its first
   entry holds. */
