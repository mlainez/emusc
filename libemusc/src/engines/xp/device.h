// Top-level MIDI device (lifecycle, SysEx/MIDI protocol decoding, the

//
// Unlike every xp_-prefixed struct elsewhere in engines/xp/ - those are
// SC-88 firmware-exact RAM and register layouts, reverse-engineered from
// SC-88's own disassembled CPU program, and stay plain C structs shared
// with not-yet-converted callers - ChannelState and Device below are this
// emulator's own bookkeeping: a received-MIDI-controller cache and a
// top-level orchestration shell, neither one a firmware RAM layout. That
// is what makes them safe to move into this namespace as real member
// state: synth.cc has only ever held a Device through an opaque pointer,
// and device_test.cc (the one caller that reads their fields directly) is
// C++ itself. Every other engines/xp/ struct (tva/tvf/renderer/engine
// internals) is untouched and keeps its extern "C" compatibility surface,
// because xp_*_test.c files besides device_test.cc still read those
// directly and are still plain C.
//
// Both remain plain aggregates with public fields rather than encapsulated
// classes - device_test.cc still reads them directly, the same reason
// every other struct in this tree stays a struct - so this move is a
// namespace and naming change, not an encapsulation one. A MidiDecoder/
// EffectsBus/Device split (protocol decoding is plausibly generic XP
// SysEx/MIDI shape, shared with a future JV-1080; the parameter-sync
// bridge, GS controller state -> engine registers, is plausibly
// SC-88-specific) stays the natural next step, visible in this file's own
// section comments, whenever that direct field access is retired too.
