 * Calibrated, not decoded: what that word is worth in cents. The manual

 * `0x0a` is 47 cents - and at full modulation that depth gives the word
 * `(10 * 127) >> 2 = 317`, so 317 stands for 47 cents. The scaling of

     `07_synthesis/pitch.md` specify - and every property of that curve
     verifies against the ROM. What is not established is the unit of the

     anchor to it measures worse at every magnitude tried: the attack
     excursion over the seven hardware recordings is 0.67 with this term
     absent, 0.67 at a quarter of the anchor, and 0.37 at the anchor
     itself. A term that only ever subtracts is not merely mis-scaled.

     The likeliest reason is one this code does not model: `lfo.md`
     records the tone-common oscillator as SHARED between voices, and
     detached when its owner is released, so "an implementation cannot
     give every voice an independent phase unconditionally". Ours does.
     Independent phases make an ensemble's vibrato incoherent, which
