   *
   *     f*f + f*q = 2

   * to a rounding unit: the residual against the exact law is -0.53 +-
   * 0.29 table units and lies in [-0.99, 0], which is the signature of a
   * floor(), not of a fit. In octaves that is 0.33 cent of cutoff.
   *
   * That expression is not a general fact about two-pole filters. It is
   * the trace of the state matrix of the forward-Euler state-variable
   * filter
   *
   *     lp[n] = lp[n-1] + f*bp[n-1]
   *     hp[n] = x[n] - lp[n] - q*bp[n-1]
   *     bp[n] = bp[n-1] + f*hp[n]
   *
   * whose trace is 2 - f*f - f*q and whose determinant is 1 - f*q. Setting
   * the trace to zero puts the pole pair at exactly +-90 degrees: the chip
   * refuses to let the filter's realised resonance climb past fs/4, and
   * the ceiling it writes for each resonance is the cutoff at which that
   * happens. A trapezoidal (bilinear) realisation is stable for every
   * positive coefficient and has no such ceiling to tabulate; its own
   * coefficient g = tan(pi*fc/fs) puts g*g + g*q at 0.906..1.000 over the
   * same table, and reading the word as a frequency instead of a sine
   * puts it at 3.211..3.414. The topology is forward-Euler.
   *
   * This is the SC-55's filter. libEmuSC's svf.cc is the same three
   * lines, and the SC-55's control ROM carries the same law twice:
   * TVFResonance[] is 128*(sqrt(q*q+4) - q) and TVFResonanceFreq[] is
   * 32*(4-f*f)/f, the two sides of that state matrix's stability edge,
   * with q = r/64 and f = x/128 (P-0130, P-0131). The SC-88 tabulates the
   * same topology at a tighter bound.
   *
   * Two things follow that the audio path could not have been told any
   * other way. The coefficient is the ROM's own word and is not warped
   * again; and a tone whose computed cutoff is clamped to this ceiling is
   * a tone the chip has been asked to leave alone - at q = 1 the law
   * gives f = 1 exactly, where the difference equations above collapse to
   * y[n] = x[n-1], a bare sample of delay. "Wide open" is realised as
   * transparent, which is what asking for a cutoff above the ceiling
   * should mean. */
