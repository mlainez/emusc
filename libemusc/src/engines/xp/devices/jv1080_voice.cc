   the eleven points, in dB relative to value 127, read with all four times
   at zero so the note is a rectangle at one level and the envelope is
   standing still. Value 0 is the noise floor.

   Its closed form is not established; the eleven points ARE the table, and
   between them this interpolates in dB, which is interpolation and not a
   recovered law. The slope converges to 0.391 dB per step at the top and
   steepens to 0.96 dB per step at value 8, so it is neither the square law

/* MEASURED (`M-015`, `M-023`): pan is a constant-power law, antisymmetric
   about value 64, and the tone and part fields index one table. These are
   the measured channel differences in dB at each distance from centre,
   after the 0.97 dB that belongs to the capture interface was cancelled by
   recording the sweep twice with L and R interchanged.

   It is a TABLE and not a trigonometric or linear law: the calibrated curve
   misses cos/sin by 2.05 dB and a linear pan by 2.07. So this interpolates
   between the measured distances rather than evaluating a formula.

   The two points past 48 are this lane's own measurement on the device, a
   tone-pan sweep of one dry part with the part's pan centred, and they
   exist because a straight line from 48 to 64 was 17 dB too wide at 56.
   The sweep also re-measures the four points above, independently and in
   the other direction: 2.21, 4.50, 9.23 and 15.50 dB against `M-015`'s
   2.20, 4.50, 9.20 and 15.60, after the 0.46 dB the interface contributes
   at centre was removed. The 60 point is the same rig reading a PART pan
   of 60 rather than a tone pan, which is a table point only under
   `M-002`/`M-048`'s finding that the two fields index one table.

   The last entry is NOT a measured difference. At a distance of 63 the
   quiet channel sits on the recorder's own noise floor (-95.9 dBFS, the
   same figure as the silence between notes), so all that is established is
   that the separation is at least 45 dB and the corner is effectively

/* MEASURED ON THE DEVICE, fourteen points across the field, with the wave's

 *   (1046.5 Hz) with the filter switched off, every LFO depth zeroed, the
 *   two later envelope levels at the top so the segment ends on a plateau,
 *   and the release at zero so notes cannot run into each other. The
 *   envelope is read off by quadrature demodulation at the carrier, which
 *   gives amplitude at about 1 ms resolution.
 *
 *   These are the full travels, in seconds, from silence to the level the
 *   segment is heading for. They are NOT the 0-to-90 % rise `M-011`

 *   against 29 ms to 17 % - an independent corroboration on a different

 *   put value 0 at 21 ms where the machine takes about 2, and that is a
 *   pick transient smeared into a whisper on every tone that asks for the
 *   fastest attack. Six of the first factory song's tones do.

 *   between 8 and 64, 12.0 between 16 and 64, 13.4 between 32 and 64 and

 *   time, and above the top of the table continues at that last measured
 *   slope, which is an extrapolation and says so.
 *

/* One position of a ping-pong loop's cycle, as a value.

   A ping-pong turn in a DIFFERENTIAL format is not a time reversal. The
   decoder accumulates deltas, so running the address back down the stream
   while still adding what it reads gives

       y[m] = x[c] + d[c] + ... + d[c-m+1] = 2*x[c] - x[c-m]

   - the loop backwards AND reflected about the value it turned at, which is
   continuous in value and in SLOPE. A plain time reversal leaves a corner
   and a forward wrap leaves a phase jump.

   The cycle is `2*span` long, `span = loop_last - loop_first + 1`:

     index < span     address loop_last-1 down to loop_first-1, REFLECTED
     index >= span    address loop_first up to loop_last, as decoded

   This ROM satisfies the invariant the turn needs. The reflected pass lands
   on x[loop_first-1] as its address reaches loop_first-1, and the cycle
   closes with no step and no drift only if x[loop_last] == x[loop_first-1].
   Decoded through this engine's own FCE decoder that holds with INTEGER
   EQUALITY on 204 OF 204 of this ROM's loop-type-1 elements - every one -
   against 1029 of 1031 for loop type 0. So loop_first-1 is answered with
   x[loop_last] directly rather than read: it can sit before the element's
   first decoded frame when a zone loops from its own start.

   THE SIBLING'S TELL-TALE IS ABSENT HERE, which is why the ROM alone could
   not settle it. On the SC-88 a forward read leaves a visible step and a
   phase jump at the join - correlation across it +0.197 against +0.968 for
   its forward loops. On this device both ends of the loop sit at EXACTLY
   ZERO: on the loop-type-1 elements examined sample by sample, x[loop_last]
   and x[loop_first-1] are both 0, and the step a FORWARD wrap would leave
   measures 0.23, 0.58 and 0.48 times the loop's own median sample-to-sample
   delta. A forward read is continuous in VALUE here, so the step says
   nothing either way.

   MEASURED ON THIS DEVICE'S OWN HARDWARE RECORDINGS (`TASK-346` AC#2), and
   the answer is the reflection. Rendering two preset rhythm kits both ways
   and comparing each against the machine's recording of the same key, in the
   key's own 520 ms slot: on the ELEVEN keys where the two readings differ at
   all, the reflected read matches the machine's sustained spectrum better on
   TEN, the one exception being a key whose correlation is 0.19 either way.
   The two tonal ones settle it outright. On the Long Whistle the machine's
   strongest partial is 2047.0 Hz: the reflected read puts it at 2038.9,
   -6.8 cents away, while the forward read's strongest is 2269.6 - it
   promotes to dominant what is only the machine's SECOND partial at 2277.
   On the Short Whistle the forward read adds partials at 3692 Hz that the
   machine does not have at all, where the reflected read's partial set is
   the machine's, 9418-9422 against 9416-9419. Both reproduce identically
   from two different kits, the same element through two banks. */

/* MEASURED ON THE DEVICE - a depth sweep with the filter's corner read
   directly.

   The stimulus isolates the scale from everything it used to be tangled
   with: the internal `White Noise` wave at its own root key, so the source
   spectrum is flat and known; LPF with resonance 100, so the corner shows
   as a peak; base cutoff 40; the F-ENV holding at its top with level 1 at
   127 and time 1 at 0; and - the point of it - THE VELOCITY SENSITIVITY AT
   ZERO, so the depth's own scale is observed rather than its product with
   the sensitivity's. The corner is read as the peak of the note's spectrum
   divided by the same wave's spectrum with the filter switched off.

   Depths +6, +12, +18 and +24 put the peak at 181.6, 521.5, 1502.9 and
   4347.7 Hz. The scale is in the units THIS ENGINE turns into a frequency,
   so the peaks are taken back through tvf_natural_hz at resonance 100
   (P-xxxx, TASK-403): cutoff 56.67, 73.05, 89.98 and 106.44, a straight
   line of

       2.771 cutoff units per unit of depth

   whose intercept, 39.98, is the 40 the cutoff was set to. A fifth point
   at depth +30 is excluded: its corner lands at 12 kHz where the machine's
   own 32 kHz output and its reconstruction filter flatten the peak.

   Three readings on other takes, all converted the same way, agree:
   `M-082`'s velocity-127 endpoint (depth +30 from cutoff 24, resonance
   80, 6.80 octaves over a velocity-1 note at 41 Hz) gives 2.769; the
   resonant peak of `tvf/fenv_level_sweep` (depth +63, levels 48 and 64
   held) 2.75 and 2.77; and where the attack and decay lines of
   `tvf/fenv_depth_p32` and `_p63` meet, 2.80 and 2.79. Read through
   `M-012`'s `fc = 341 * 2^((cutoff-64)/10)` instead, the same four peaks
   give 2.545 - a law of ten units per octave that tvf_cutoff_hz does not
   follow above cutoff 80, where it runs eight to ten.

   Measured with the SENSITIVITY AT ZERO, and that case is confirmed
   rather than assumed: at depth +30 with sensitivity 0 the corner sits at
   8003.9, 8001.0 and 8003.9 Hz for velocities 1, 64 and 127: sensitivity

                      ceiling. That is the curve read at 127 - 2 (127 - v):
                      64 maps to 1 (predicted 41.6), 96 to 65 (0.518 of

   32 are faster than a 32 ms analysis window resolves and are not
   measured here; they take the same ratio, and value 0 is instant as the
   table's is.

   What is observed is the RATE, which is depth scale over time: the 2.50

   The exact constant is not recovered - the nine readings spread 6 % -
   and the machine's own time table is in its internal ROM.

   `t = t_64 * (1 - vs * 0.0090 * (vel - 64))`, vs from -1 to +1 across the
   15-entry enum. At the extremes that is x1.57 at velocity 1 and x0.43 at
   127 - a span of 3.7, not the 1.30 `M-070` measured on the pitch and
   filter envelopes' own fields, which `closeout/fenv_vel_t1_i*` confirm
   (the band-crossing times span 1.30 there too).

   Read on `envelopes/aenv_vel_t1_i{00,07,14}` (A-ENV T1 64, level velocity
   sensitivity 0, filter off) as the 10-90 % amplitude rise: index 7 is
   1.042 s at all six velocities; index 14 gives 1.606, 1.480, 1.330,
   1.028, 0.712 and 0.432 s at velocities 1, 16, 32, 64, 96 and 127, and
   index 0 their mirror about 64 (0.436 ... 1.610). As a ratio to index 7
   the points lie on one straight line in velocity to 0.017 rms, and not on
   one in log time (log2 ratio 0.62, 0.51, 0.35, -0.02, -0.55, -1.27). A
   free line puts the pivot at 63.6 and the slope at 0.0090 per velocity;
   the index-14 and index-0 end points alone give 0.0091.

   NOT RECOVERED: every take is time 1 = 64, so that the scale is a factor
   on the time (rather than an offset in seconds) at other values is
   assumed, as for the other envelopes; indices between 0, 7 and 14 are
   interpolated linearly; and the rhythm note's one field is unmeasured.
   The time-4 field is NOT applied: `envelopes/aenv_vel_t4_i{00,07,14}`
   (T4 64, each note released at 800 ms) fall 10, 20 and 40 dB in 0.34,
   0.68 and 1.28 s at every velocity and index, within 1.5 %. Their
   note-offs all carry velocity 64, so whether the note-OFF velocity
   drives that field is not measured. */

/* Resonance as the two-pole section's Q, in dB. The peak gain of a
   two-pole section is its Q for a Q well above unity; the chip's own
   coefficient form is unknown (`L-05`) and is not what this reproduces.

   MEASURED (`M-021`, `M-118`): from value 8 to 96 about 0.28 dB per step -
   two-pole fits to the white-noise resonance sweeps read within 0.6 dB of
   it at cutoffs 40, 64 and 80 - and at value 0 a Q of 0.84 (-1.76, -1.36
   and -1.56 dB there), not 1. Between 0 and 8 nothing is measured and the
   dB runs straight between the two.

   Above 96 the peak is narrower than those takes' spectra resolve, and
   M-021's peak readings there (46.7 dB at 127 on cutoff 64, 67.4 on 112)
   are resolution-limited. It is read instead from each note's ENERGY: our
   render of the same file with the filter off, passed through this section
   from the note-on over the same window, gives the energy any Q produces
   against Q 0.84, and the Q that matches the take's own ratio is the
   take's. The method reads our engine's own Q back to 0.25 dB. On the
   hardware it reads the same increments over value 96 at cutoffs 64, 80,
   96 and 112, within 0.5 dB: +3.5 at 104, +6.0 at 112, +12.4 at 120, and at
   127 at least +42 - the method's own ceiling, the machine at the edge of
   self-oscillation. Cutoff 40 reads lower and is not used: its peak, at
   59 Hz, is inside the interface's roll-off. The increments are added to
   the law's value at 96; between the measured values the dB runs straight.

   On the absolute level at 88 and 96 the two methods part by up to 2.5 dB
   (energy below the law, the fits above it at cutoff 64), which says the
   machine's peak is not exactly a two-pole's shape; that is not resolved. */

/* A two-pole section per filter type. MEASURED (`M-017`): all four types
   are active and each has the response its name says - the type register
   reading zero says the type is carried elsewhere, not that the types are
   unused.

   THE REALISATION, MEASURED at the machine's 32 kHz (`P-xxxx`, TASK-381,
   `tvf/cutoff_{lpf,hpf,bpf,pkg}_res000` and `_res064`, White Noise, each
   slot against `filter_type_all_res000`'s filter-OFF note - the two
   sessions agree to 0.0 dB where a slot is transparent). Candidate
   sections share these poles and differ only in their zeros; on cutoffs
   64 to 104, in third-octave bands to 14 kHz:
     LPF  no zeros, unity at DC. Within 0.6 dB at 80, 88 and 96, where a
          bilinear section (a double zero at Nyquist) is 26 dB under at
          14 kHz. On the cookbook's poles it read up to 2.7 dB bright
          between 5 and 9 kHz at 104; its poles are the matched ones in
          set_biquad, which read up to 1.5 dB bright there (2.4 at
          11 kHz, where the filter-off slots read 1.6 bright as well).
     HPF  a double zero at DC and no scaling, so the passband rises over
          0 dB toward Nyquist as the machine's does (+5.6 dB at 9 kHz at
          104): 1.06 and 0.82 dB rms at resonance 0 and 64, against 2.61
          and 1.04 for a section scaled to unity at Nyquist.
     BPF  one zero, at DC, with the section's Q at the natural frequency:
          0.50 dB rms at resonance 64, where a peak held at 0 dB is 18 dB
          off; 1.36 at resonance 0, where its level runs 0.3 dB under at 64
          and 5 dB under at 104. Up to resonance 96 the peak of Q stands
          on the band-pass's own take at 64 and on the section's peak law,
          which the low-pass's resonance-96 take confirms to 0.0 to 1.3 dB
          rms. Above 96 the peak is held at 0 dB, on two poles and zeros at
          DC and Nyquist. What that boundary rests on is patches, not a
          take: a peak of Q is right for `Bassoon` (resonance 70) and
          `Velo Tekno 1` (90) and puts `Dissimilate` and `Tortured` (100)
          and `Biosphere` (127) over theirs, `Biosphere` by 19 dB, so the
          transition lies between 90 and 100. 96 is the nearest resonance
          with a measured law, not a measurement of the transition.
     PKG  as below; the one-zero variant reads 0.82 and 0.72 against this
          form's 1.23 and 0.49, so neither is preferred and this one stays.
          Both stay under the machine above its peak at 96 and 104, by up
          to 6.6 dB at 14 kHz.
   These are the outputs of a state-variable section, the topology the
   sibling engine's own chip runs (tvf.cc). The poles are the cookbook
   biquad's at the natural frequency and Q below for HPF, BPF and PKG, and
   the analog section's mapped by z = e^(sT) for the LPF (set_biquad),
   which is this model's choice; the chip's own coefficient form is
   internal (`L-05`).

   This writes the coefficients and leaves the delay line alone, because
   the filter envelope re-solves it while the note is sounding and
   restarting the section every millisecond would put a step in the output
   at every control block. */
/* THE SECTION RUNS AS A STATE-VARIABLE FILTER. The coefficients above
   define the transfer function; what realises it is a trapezoidal
   state-variable section (the Simper form) whose poles and mix are solved
   from them exactly, so for a held cutoff the response is the direct
   form's to rounding. The two differ only while the coefficients move: a
   direct form's state is the last outputs, and when a square LFO or a
   step throws the corner from 1.5 kHz to 4 Hz in one control block that
   state drives a transient hundreds of times full scale. The state here
   is the two integrators', which carry over a coefficient change without
   gaining energy. What structure the machine's own filter uses is not
   known; this one is chosen because it cannot run away, which the
   hardware plainly does not. On `tvf/fenv_depth_p63` the falling sweep
   after the level peak reads within 1 dB of the hardware take, where the
   direct form reads 9 to 10 dB high (`M-142`).

   With s = (1/g)(z-1)/(z+1) on s^2 + k s + 1, the denominator is
   z^2 + a1 z + a2 when g^2 = (1+a1+a2)/(1-a1+a2) and
   g k = 4/(1-a1+a2) - 1 - g^2; the numerator b0 z^2 + b1 z + b2 is then
   A/4 (b0-b1+b2) of the high-pass output, A/(2g) (b0-b2) of the band-pass

     `wave_metadata.md` carries this field as "fine tune, typical

     measurement cannot pin - `Orch. Hit`, which is a stab with no pitch,
     `Rot.Org Fst`, whose second harmonic is louder than its fundamental,
     and `EG Harm`, a guitar harmonic.

     PL1  adds to the tone's own pitch LFO depth in cents, through the same
          depth law. The matrix's own readings run 3-9 % above that law at
          the same depth; that gap is not recovered and not fitted.
     L1R  0.198 Hz per step, linear in hertz rather than in rate units, and
          clamped at 0 Hz - three points 5, 20, 63 at rate 64.
     PAN  2 pan-table units of distance per step, both signs (`M-155`, the
          corpus `routing/matrix_dest_all_{pos,neg}` takes: at effective
          depths 8.9, 17.9 and 26.8 the channel difference reads 18.6,
          35.3, 53.3 units right and 17.8, 34.8, 51.9 left through the pan
          table, 1.94-2.08 per step; 35.7 and above are hard). It adds to
          the voice's own pan and the tone's pan LFO, and the sum is clamped
          to the table once (`M-155`, `pan_clamp`: tone pan 64, PAN +63 and
          a pan LFO of +63 on a square stay hard right through both halves
          at CC1 127, and at CC1 64 the bottom half lands on centre, 0.0 dB).
     FL1  2.3 cutoff units per step, LINEAR, added to the tone's own filter
          LFO swing (`M-155`, `fl_law`/`fl_sum`: White Noise through LPF 86
          resonance 80 under a key-triggered TRI at rate 64, the resonant
          peak read at the triangle's tops and bottoms). The corner moves
          0.41, 0.80, 1.61, 2.48 and 3.18 octaves at depths 2, 4, 8, 12 and
          16, -8 the mirror of +8; read back through tvf_natural_hz, whose
          static peak here lands within 1 % of the machine's, that is
          2.20-2.36 units per step over twelve unclipped half-cycles, mean
          2.29 - CUT's own 2.3 (`M-116`). Tone depths 16 and 32 with the
          matrix at +-8 land on the sum of the two swings. It is not the
          tone depth's own law (`M-114`), 0.31 octave at 16. Above 16 each
          half of the swing clips against the resonant peak's ceiling or
          the analysis floor, so the line is carried on there, not
          measured.
     FL2  the same on the second LFO, measured at 8 and +-16.

   PL2 and L2R are taken as PL1 and L1R on the second LFO, which is not
   measured. MIX, CHO and REV (the sends), AL1/AL2 and pL1/pL2 are NOT
   IMPLEMENTED: a slot routed to one does nothing. */

     This read was two-point linear, on `M-087`. THAT MEASUREMENT IS
     WITHDRAWN ON THE KERNEL by `M-107` and `M-108`, and the reason is
     instructive rather than a correction of arithmetic: M-087 ranked
     four candidates by time-domain correlation, all four of them
     INTERPOLATING kernels and therefore the identity at fraction 0, so
     none of them could represent a chip that smooths when the fraction
     is zero and the ranking could not detect one. Linear won by being
     the least sharp of four candidates all sharper than the chip. Read
     as a RESPONSE instead, over 42 dB of span, a cubic B-spline fits to
     0.63 and 0.59 dB rms on the two waves against two-point linear's
     5.48 and 4.23; and a dedicated unity-ladder capture measures the
     fraction-0 weights directly as `[w, 1-2w, w]` with
     w = 0.1614 +- 0.0088, against 1/6 for the cubic (0.6 sigma) and 0
     for every interpolating kernel (18.3 sigma). The chip is NOT
     transparent at its own root key: it is 8.4 dB down at theta 0.39
     where a linear read would be flat.

     What that costs in the mix is the top octave. Reading linearly left
     the interpolation's images unsmoothed, and against a hardware take

   product. Types 6, 8 and 10 restore the sine at -35.2; 5, 7 and 9 do not.
   The f2 +- f1 sidebands stand 26.5 dB (geometric mean) above the sum, in
   dB, of type 1's saw fundamental and sine. A product's scale moves with
   the level gauge, taken here as the 512-patch sweep's median: our renders
   4.6 dB over the takes. Against this take alone our saw runs 6.7 dB over
   and the sine 4.4, so the scale is good to about 2 dB. The two sidebands
   part the wrong way, f2 + f1 1.4 dB over f2 - f1 against 1.4 dB under on
   the machine; that is not resolved.

   THE BOOSTER (`M-143`, `P-xxxx`: a sine on tone 2 of a type 3 or 4 pair,
   tone 1 at level 1, drive set by wave gain and booster together, filters
   on and off; confirming `M-134`'s reading of the `booster_1_2` takes) is a
   gain of exactly 2^boost - 1, 2, 4, 8, read two independent ways at boosts
   1 and 2 to 0.01 dB - into a symmetric hard clip (h2 absent at -74 dB)
   shared by both tones: two sines through it intermodulate. Its ceiling
   stands 0.2 dB above the peak of a wave-gain-0 `Sine`, so wave gain alone
   reaches it at boost 0, and that one ceiling places h1 at all six drives
   within 0.03 dB. h3 and h5 run a steady ~0.6 dB under a hard clip's, not
   resolved. Tone 2's wave gain drives the clip; its level scales the
   output after it (the level's square law holds at two depths of clip);
   the rest of A2, envelope and velocity, is taken to follow it there, not
   measured. Type 3 filters tone 1's TVF before the clip
   and tone 2's after it; type 4 puts both after it, and with the filters
   off the two are one stage. Tone 2 passes tone 1's TVF in both.

   The ceiling below is that sine's peak here, 0.4849 (the probe read at
   wave gain +12: 1.9303 over 3.9811), and 0.2 dB over it. Rendered against
   the capture's own takes, every slot of all four files - both types,
   boosts 0-3, drives -6 to +30 dB, each filter on and off, pair 3&4 - lies
   a steady 1.0-1.7 dB under the machine on h1, the same as its type-1
   control slots, so the offset is the sine's own level, not the booster.

   WHICH FILTER EACH SIGNAL PASSES THROUGH - all that separates 5 from 7
   from 9, and 6 from 8 from 10 - rests on the diagrams alone: the takes
   run with the filters off and cannot see it. */
