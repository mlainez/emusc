 *  Roland JV-1080 constants for the XP engine (engines/xp/).

 *  This device runs the same sound chip as the SC-88 and carries the
 *  identical Roland part number for it, but its firmware is a different
 *  thing entirely: the SC-88's is in an external ROM and disassembles,
 *  while the JV-1080's synthesis engine lives in the SH7034's 64 KB
 *  internal mask ROM, which has never been dumped.
 *
 *  SO NOTHING HERE IS A FIRMWARE PORT, AND NOTHING HERE MAY BE READ AS
 *  FIRMWARE-EXACT. What the external ROM holds - the preset records, the
 *  parameter map, the wave tables, the effect coefficient data - is read
 *  from it and is exact. Everything the voice path does with those values
 *  is a BEHAVIOURAL MODEL fitted to laws measured on the hardware: a
 *  transfer function that responds the way the machine does, not the
 *  arithmetic the machine uses to get there. engines/xp/README.md says the
 *  same thing about this device from the other side, and each law below
 *  carries the measurement it comes from.
 *
 *  The device facts themselves live in struct XpDeviceProfile
