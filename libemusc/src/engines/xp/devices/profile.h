 *   state is the chip's own register and RAM layout, and its scheduler
 *   recomposes every voice from ROM tables once per control period
 *   (engine.h, renderer.h). The other's synthesis engine is in an undumped
 *   internal mask ROM, so its voice path is a behavioural model fitted to
 *   measured hardware and has no control period, no amplitude register and
 *   no ROM table to read. A shared per-voice struct would be a lie about
 *   both.
 *
 *   What IS shared is everything above the voice: the top-level MIDI
 *   device, its channel state, the wave ROM descramble, the record readers
 *   and the output mixing. So a device supplies this table and the shared
 *   device layer calls through it, naming no device.
 *
 *   A device that leaves XpDeviceProfile::voiceEngine null is served by
 *   engine.h/renderer.h instead, which is where this family started.
 *
 *   `rom` and `banks` stay owned by the caller and outlive the state.
 *   `sysex_block` receives one DT1 payload whole, with its address as the
 *   bytes that arrived. Whole, because a device's own frames may run past
 *   an address-byte boundary and a per-address call has nowhere to carry;
 *   as bytes, because how those bytes pack into a number is the device's
 *   own convention and not something shared code should decide. */
