// The JV-880's policy, from its firmware (scdb devices/jv880/06_voice_engine/
// allocation.md, D-44 and D-67). Task 4 (ROM1 0x0892) takes a voice from lists
// that Task 8 (ROM1 0x1AC8) rebuilds each round from a master list of all 28
// voices: first a free voice; then the head of list B, which holds, for every
// part, its first (active - reserve) voices in MASTER order; then the
// requesting part's own list; and when the part has none of its own, no voice
// at all.
//
// The master list is NOT plain allocation order. Task 8 sorts it by two of the
// allocator's masks before walking it (ROM1 0x1C31-0x1C89): voices whose GATE
// bit @0x8128 is clear go first, then gated voices whose key-down bit @0x812C
// is clear, then the rest - each group in allocation order. The allocator sets
// both bits for a new voice (0xAFE, 0xB0D); the note-off routine (0x1878-
// 0x19FC) clears the gate, or only the key-down bit when the tone's Hold-1
// switch is on and the part's hold pedal (@0x6176) is down; the envelope task
// reads the gate as its release trigger (0x2612). So a RELEASED voice is taken
// before a pedal-held one, and a pedal-held one before a key that is still
// down, oldest first inside each group. A released voice stays in the pool
// until its T4 countdown ends (0x2821), so it still counts against the 28.
//
// Measured on the reference (scdb M-061, D-67): with 28 voices sounding and
// one of them released 0.1-2 s earlier, a new note takes the released voice
// and cuts its tail; with all 28 held it takes the oldest. Demo song 3
// "Synthony" plays 0.1 s chords whose tails run 2.5 s under a held pad, and
// ordering by age alone stole the pad 283 times where the device never does.
//
//  * one VOICE is taken, not a note: the note it came from keeps its other
//    tones (ROM1 0xE1B re-links the voice into the new note's chain and the
//    old note's chain closes around the gap). Tone 4 of a note was allocated
//    first (ROM1 0xA72, r3 = 3 down to 0), so it is the oldest of its note;
//  * the reserve is the loaded performance's Voice Reserve (Performance
//    Common +0x14..+0x1B, copied to @0x8C53 at ROM1 0x2BA6), a floor no other
//    part can reach under. With every part at or under its reserve the
//    requesting part recycles the head of its own list rather than staying
//    silent.
//
// The firmware's list is rebuilt once per Task 8 round rather than per voice;
// recomputing it here for every request idealises that. What the chip does to
// a voice re-keyed while it sounds is silicon, so the stolen partial fades at
// the device's damp rate.

// one parameter was worth 4.36 dB. "Lost Weekend" writes part parameter 0x17
// on seven parts. scdb D-57.
//
// Only parameters this project has identified are acted on. An unknown one is
// ignored rather than guessed at, because a wrong write is worse than none.
